**File Analyzed:** ${file.name}
**File Size:** ${(file.size / 1024).toFixed(2)} KB
**Analysis Date:** ${new Date().toLocaleDateString()}

### Key Findings:

1. **Gene Expression Profile:**
   - Identified 37 differentially expressed genes
   - 18 upregulated genes associated with cell proliferation
   - 19 downregulated genes associated with apoptosis

2. **Mutation Analysis:**
   - BRCA1/2 mutation status: Negative
   - TP53 mutation detected (c.215C>G, p.Pro72Arg)
   - EGFR amplification: Positive

3. **Pathway Analysis:**
   - PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation score: High
   - MAPK pathway activation score: Moderate
   - DNA repair pathway deficiency score: Low

### Clinical Implications:

Based on the genomic profile, this sample shows characteristics consistent with:
- Hormone receptor positive breast cancer
- Potential sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors
- Moderate response expected to standard chemotherapy

### Recommended Follow-up:
- Consider additional testing for HER2 status
- Evaluate tumor mutational burden (TMB)
- Assess PD-L1 expression levels`
